This will be a short blog post, laying out the alternatives we plan to use during the event. More details will also be published soon, as guides on the <a href=\"https://github.com/SAPOnlineTrack/SAPOnlineTrack-2020\">SAP Online Track Github page</a>, and on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/saponlinetrack\">SAP Online Track YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-alternatives\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-alternatives\" aria-label=\"the alternatives permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The alternatives</h2>\n<p>Our focus is to make the job of the presenters as manageable as possible, while at the same time being available for the participants of the event. We use the terms stream moderator and steam producer. These are two designated roles, not necessarily two persons. With that in mind, here are the 3 alternatives. </p>\n<h3 id=\"option-1---easy-mode\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#option-1---easy-mode\" aria-label=\"option 1   easy mode permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Option 1 - Easy mode</h3>\n<p>Presenter share their screen using Discord \"Go Live\" functionality. That's it! 😊</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/how-to-present-at-SAP-Online-Track/go-live.png\" alt=\"Discord Go Live button\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/how-to-present-at-SAP-Online-Track/select-screen.png\" alt=\"Select screen to share\">\nA stream producer will be responsible for getting the presentation to the YouTube broadcast, and insert title- and end-cards.</p>\n<p>The stream moderator will handle moderation of the Q&#x26;A part, and the Q&#x26;A will be a part of the stream.</p>\n<p>The presenter is invited to keep the discussion going in one of the unconference channels, after the session.</p>\n<h3 id=\"option-2---offline-mode\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#option-2---offline-mode\" aria-label=\"option 2   offline mode permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Option 2 - Offline mode</h3>\n<p>Presenters record their session offline, and share it with the SAP Online Track team. The team will add title- and end-cards to the video, and prepare for YouTube premiere at the set schedule. On the event, the YouTube video will go live (like a livestream), and the presenter will be able to answer questions in the text chat, during the event. After the session, the presenter can hold a Q&#x26;A in one of the unconference channels.</p>\n<p>The Q&#x26;A sessions will unfortunately not be recorded by the team, and naturally cannot be a part of the video presentation.</p>\n<p>We encourage the presenters using this method, to use the Q&#x26;A sessions as the basis of a blog post (or more).</p>\n<h3 id=\"option-3---diy-mode\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#option-3---diy-mode\" aria-label=\"option 3   diy mode permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Option 3 - DIY mode</h3>\n<p>Presenters experienced with steaming to YouTube, can opt for the DIY method. Here the presenter will receive the YouTube stream key of the session, to be used in the streaming software of choice, and be responsible for getting a signal to the broadcast. The SAP Online Track team will still be the ones administering the broadcast on YouTube, but the presenter is in complete control of the rest. </p>\n<p>The SAP Online Track team will provide event specific graphics, like title- and end-cards. There will also be a Discord moderator assisting with moderation and administration of the Discord activities and Q&#x26;A session.</p>\n<p>The presenter is invited to keep the discussion going in one of the unconference channels, after the session, and could also be able to keep on recording, if coordinated with the SAP Online Track team. That way, all is preserved for the future.</p>\n<p>This method demands close coordination with the SAP Online Track team, but we encourage all that are able to use it, as it has fewer points of failure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-closing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#in-closing\" aria-label=\"in closing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>In closing</h2>\n<p>While all three options have their pros and cons, the most important actions for all presenters, besides selecting a option, is testing beforehand to make sure everything flies. The SAP Online Track team can help with this upon request, if presenters would like to do an end-to-end test.</p>\n<p>Please voice your opinions, by joining us for a discussion on the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/saponlinetrack-discord\">SAP Online Track Discord Server</a>.</p>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"How to present at SAP Online Track With May closing in, and SAP Online Track approaching, it is time to have a look at the different options…","frontmatter":{"title":"How to present at SAP Online Track","cover":"/images/post-header.png","date":"2020-04-14","category":"general","tags":["presenting"],"author":"ronnie"},"fields":{"slug":"/how-to-present-at-sap-online-track"}},"prev":{"id":"1106c22b-e0f1-5b0d-80d1-d29bb739a301","excerpt":"Description As a speaker posting your own blog post to the SAP Online Track Site can really help promote your…","frontmatter":{"title":"Site Blogging","cover":"/images/post-header.png","date":"2020-05-05"},"fields":{"slug":"/site-blogging"}},"next":{"id":"63412811-123e-540a-8a68-8dbd3e647744","excerpt":"Description It will be an online-only event spanning 24 hours.
