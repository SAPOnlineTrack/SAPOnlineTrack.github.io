The intent is that we can then cover all time zones. We are relying on the community to host sessions that we will stream online. The plan is to create online social activities as well throughout the 24 hours to keep the engagement going. We will host the sessions and have a chat community on the side for people to network.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-are-we-doing-this\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-are-we-doing-this\" aria-label=\"why are we doing this permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why are we doing this</h2>\n<p>In short, we felt the time was right to try it out. The <a href=\"https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/events/SAP+Inside+Track\">SAP Inside Track</a> movement has really taken off and this is an attempt to create a global event to have heaps of content made available for the community.</p>\n<p>Also, we are making this a <a href=\"https://www.classy.org/team/285233\">fundraising event</a>, where we are raising money for <a href=\"https://girlswhocode.com/\">GirlsWhoCode</a>. So while the event will be free for everyone to join, please consider donating to this great cause. This is really something that has a big personal interest for our team to raise awareness of the huge gender gap in technology. Especially in SAP, you can listen to the <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/sap-community-podcast/episodes/Episode-35-Where-are-the-women-in-the-SAP-Community-eal8bc/a-a1dk1gu\">SAP Coffee Corner</a> podcast with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yojibee\">Anne Kathrine Petterøe</a> if you want to learn more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-is-this-taking-place\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#when-is-this-taking-place\" aria-label=\"when is this taking place permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>When is this taking place</h2>\n<p>The event will start on the 30th of May 2020 at 12 noon CET. Then the aim is to keep the event going for 24 hours until noon on the 31st of May. We hope we will get enough sessions to fill all the 24 hours and hopefully in multiple tracks, so there is something for everyone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-can-i-present\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-can-i-present\" aria-label=\"how can i present permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How can I present</h3>\n<p>You might think that you need a semi professional setup to do a session. Trust me you really don’t. A computer, headset and an internet connection is enough. You can also chose whether or not you want to use Webcam. This is entirely up to you. No pressure from our side. We really just appreciate your contribution.</p>\n<p>Please submit your proposal <a href=\"https://forms.gle/NMY31ips5KwqM8c97\">here</a> before the 1st of may.
